# jscomponent

Acrux component is a javascript based component built to be used in web application as a single unit which manages users/system actions, storage, supports IO operations for view.

It is designed based on message driven architecture using Rx.JS and is loosely coupled from View point of view. So you can use the view engine you like by making sure to link it with the DisplayAdapter in order to bridge the IO operations between Acrux component and View.
